<p>Hi! I'm Alwin, a second-year MS CS student who transitioned from cybersecurity consulting at Deloitte to AI/ML engineering. Most recently, I interned at ChargePoint working on LLM-powered test automation for their consumer-facing app and website. I'm currently working on research exploring fairness in multi-stakeholder marketplace recommendations, essentially how to balance user satisfaction, seller fairness, and platform health in recommendation algorithms. 

I took CS6120 in Spring 2025 and loved the hands-on approach to building NLP systems from scratch. I'm excited to help you navigate this course and make this journey smoother for you all.
