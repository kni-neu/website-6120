    <p>Hi! I'm Joy (Hsin Yu) Guo, and I'm happy to be one of your CS6120 Teaching Assistants for the semester. I'm a 3rd year CS Align student here at Northeastern University. Prior to this, I studied Bioinformatics at UC San Diego, where I discovered my love for finding patterns in complex data. My experience ranges from research to internships - I've worked in environmental sciences where I genetically engineered crops, and published papers on disease detection using CNNs, and analyzing medical bias using NLP. Most recently, I interned as an ML engineer at a startup where I got the chance to build and deploy a production ML pipeline which was exciting! </p>

  <p>I'm particularly excited about NLP's power to bridge human communication with computational analysis, and I look forward to exploring this with you all this semester!

### A Little More About Myself
Outside of academics, I enjoy bouldering, board games/poker, reading, learning new skills, playing piano, and exploring good food and new destinations.
