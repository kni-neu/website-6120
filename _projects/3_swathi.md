<p>Hi! I'm Swathi Arasu, a second-year MS Data Science student. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and bring two years of experience as a Research Engineer. During that time, I worked extensively on applying Machine Learning to modernize systems built using legacy programming languages. I also contributed to enhancing a conversational AI system by enabling robust multilingual support, allowing the chatbot to communicate effectively with a diverse user base.

This fall, I’m thrilled to be a Teaching Assistant for Natural Language Processing. Having taken the course myself, I’m especially excited to revisit core concepts with a fresh perspective. 
</p>

<p>NLP’s unique blend of language and computation continues to inspire me, and I look forward to supporting students through that journey.
