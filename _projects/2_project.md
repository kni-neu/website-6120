Hello, I'm Haoping Lin, and I'm thrilled to be your CS6220 Teaching Assistant for this semester. I graduated from Pennsylvania State University and continue my way being a software engineer. Piano and guitar are my two of my interests. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any assists. I'm ready to help!
