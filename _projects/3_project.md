### From the Unknown to Discovery

My academic path has been unconventional, taking me through Physics, Electrical Engineering, Finance, and Math before I made a shift to Computer Science. Along the way, I’ve embraced the uncertainty of the future, trusting that the connections between these experiences will reveal themselves in time. Each step has been part of a broader process of **mining and self-discovery**, where meaning is forged through reflection and exploration.
