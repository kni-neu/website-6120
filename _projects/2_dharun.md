<p>Hi! I’m Dharun, one of your CS6120 Teaching Assistants this semester. I’m a grad student at Northeastern who’s spent some time juggling internships at Bevi and Clade, and I’ve also worked as a Data Scientist at Swiggy — the Indian version of Doordash, which laid the foundation for my journey in Data Science and Machine Learning. 

My interests bounce around from generative models to Inference Efficiency —  a fancy way of saying I like solving complicated problems without losing my mind. I’ve taken CS6120 before, so I know the thrill of wrestling with transformers and trying to not hit the CUDA OOM error. I’m here to help make this journey a little easier (and maybe have some fun while doing it). Feel free to reach out with questions, ideas, or to debate whether AI will ever truly “get” us humans. Looking forward to a great semester!

### A Little More About Myself

Outside of academics, I’m a soccer enthusiast. Master’s studies take up most of my time, but I always try to keep a balance between work and life(but we all know how that goes).
