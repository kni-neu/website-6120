<p>Hi there! My name is Qunnie, and I am so excited to be your Teaching Assistant this semester!  
This is my fifth semester as a CS Align student. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia, where I majored in Financial Economics and Statistics. This summer, I interned at Goldman Sachs as a Software Engineering intern, which gave me valuable industry experience.  

I also took this class last semester and learned a lot—don’t worry if you don’t have a background in NLP, the course is very approachable and you’ll pick things up along the way. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!
