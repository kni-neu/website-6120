#### neural newtork fundamentals
-----

In this homework, we will gain the fundamentals of neural networks, implementing a two layer neural network by hand. An outsized portion of this homework (more than others) is rooted in linear algebra fundamentals, [Here are some mathematical properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE) that will help you in derivations.  Review the homework in this [pdf file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/assignment-2.pdf). Remember that reading resources can be found in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus).

#### data and starter kit
-----

Along with some [helpful properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE), you will need the [utility functions](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120s25/data/twitter/utils.py) and [twitter data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120s25/data/twitter/twitter_data.pkl) at our [website](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120s25/data/twitter/). You can also feel free to use the homework template [assignment2.py]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/python/assignment2.py). Please develop in Python **without** the aid of libraries (e.g., tensorflow, keras, pytorch, jax, etc.) besides `numpy`, as our autograders will be grading accordingly. If you are more comfortable with notebooks, there are several options:

* [Locally on Your Laptop](https://jupyter.org/install)
* [Google Cloud Vertex Work](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench) with your Google Cloud credits. 
* [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/) with your Google Account

Document templates can be either [Overleaf TeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gbwryydmdjhv) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8fpJo-gF_L0_TwUdw5E7x7faOAStK4n). When you've compiled/finished writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link.
