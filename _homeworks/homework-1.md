### getting started with data
-----

Please review the homework in this [pdf file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/assignment-1.pdf). Remember that reading resources can be found in the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus).

-----
### data and starter kit
-----

You will need [the data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/) for the review portion and [netflix data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) for the exploration portion.

Here are the starter kits that you might find useful.

* Document templates can be either [LaTeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gbwryydmdjhv) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8fpJo-gF_L0_TwUdw5E7x7faOAStK4n). When you've compiled/finished writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link.

* You may find [Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com) useful, which you can subsequently download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.) In Colab, you can download the data with 

  ```
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/movie_titles.csv
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_1.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_2.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_3.txt
  !wget https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/fall2023/homework-1/netflix-data/combined_data_4.txt
  ```

* You can use any repository system to submit code as long as there is an online link to it. The standard way is to use Github, but you can have a sharepoint folder too as long as it's clear what each individual file is.

-----
#### submission instructions
-----

Commit all your materials to your repository, and submit via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/583114). There, you will upload your PDF and provide the link to your repository, which should have all the code that you used to generate your solutions. You will also enter in your functions for testing.

#### project checkpoint
-----

Each week, there will be a checkpoint for you project so that you are on track to turn in the project at the end of the semester. In your homework this week, you will

* start surveying the available data (preferably *outside* of Kaggle). List three interesting datasets here.
* start introducing yourself to your classmates and seeing whether or not you'd like to form a team. List the names of three classmates that you've met.
