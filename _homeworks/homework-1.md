### data and starter kit
-----

You will need [the data](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120f25/data/shakespeare/), which we'll be using throughout the semester. The Bash command is

```
wget --no-check-certificate https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120f25/data/shakespeare/shakespeare-edit.txt
```

You can use Jupyter and Google Colab magick commands (calling Bash from inside of a notebook) with the `!` indicator. For example, `!wget <options> <file>` will suffice. If you are more comfortable with notebooks, there are several options:

* [Locally on Your Laptop](https://jupyter.org/install)
* [Google Cloud Vertex Work](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench) with your Google Cloud credits. (Enable Notebooks API).
* [Google Colabs](https://colab.research.google.com/) with your Google Account

#### project checkpoint
-----

Each week, there will be a checkpoint for you project so that you are on track to turn in the project at the end of the semester. In your homework this week, you will

* start surveying the available data (preferably *outside* of Kaggle). List three interesting datasets here.
* start introducing yourself to your classmates and seeing whether or not you'd like to form a team. List the names of three classmates that you've met.
