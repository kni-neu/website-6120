We'll provide an extension to [assignment 2](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120f25/assets/pdf/assignment-2.pdf) (Deep Learning) due later on Friday. A reminder that all homeworks have pdfs. For this particular homework, feel free to use [this website](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/matrix/calculus.html) of matrix / vector calculus.

Feel free to add your introduction to the [class document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gXwcOyE6wKQHiapdL65mO35HKHY-UAaWz5QpVejsag/edit?tab=t.0).

Make sure  you have [reserved a spot](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120f25/readings/) for reading videos. This week marks the first week of reading group videos. I hope it's entertaining! You will "turn in" your videos and PDFs by linking on the spreadsheet.
