The primary book resources for this class are:

* **[Speech and Language Processing (3rd Ed Draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/ed3book_aug25.pdf)** - Dan Jurafsky and James Martin conduct a labor of love that continues updating nearly monthly. Widely regarded as the “bible” of NLP, this comprehensive text covers everything from morphology to parsing, semantics, discourse, and pragmatic applications like machine translation and speech recognition. It's continually updated and even made available for free online, making it an ideal first-stop resource. Check frequently at their [site](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) for any new releases.

Beyond this book, please make sure that you have filled out a spot on the [reading group sheet](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120f25/readings/). Each group of four people will collectively collaborate and create a single video and writeup. Looking forward to seeing the entertaining videos! 

**Please sign up before the end of next week, Friday, 9/22/2025**.
