Swwathi, Huining, and Dharun will be holding the second recitation on linear algebra on Friday, September 19, in San Jose 4N, Room 1014. If there is not enough room in R1014, we can move to one of the labs near the Welcome Center. You may find it useful to review [some properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE/edit).
