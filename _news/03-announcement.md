Instruction will be *in-classroom*, but I'll make the best effort to be available online for anyone who has questions outside of lectures. 

* Please note that our first lecture will occur in Room 906 and **not** our regular room of Room 301, which will be our assigned room for the semester. All subsequent lectures will occur in Room 301.

* Note the absence on October 31; there will be no lecture then. You will have a bit of reprieve after your midterm exam. Happy Halloween!

* Our [teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aY043MpXT47Duh1mwK_TunPsNrVXGH8xgfnvCLO67rco1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=e31a60da-d05c-4951-8ba9-fa1c4cc69b09&tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7) is now active. Right now, the available channel is general, but we will include homework channels.

* Our class e-mail is [cs6220-class@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-class.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail the enrolled students in CS6220 as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment.

* Our staff e-mail is [cs6220-staff@ccs.neu.edu](mailto:cs6220-staff.ccs.neu.edu). This will e-mail instructor and teaching assistant as they appear on Canvas and Khoury enrollment.
