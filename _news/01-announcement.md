Hello everyone, happy new year, and welcome to CS 6120: Natural Language Processing for Spring 2026!

We’re living in an extraordinary moment for language technology. Over the past few years, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and Llama have gone from research curiosities to tools that millions of people use daily. They write, translate, summarize, code, and even reason in ways that feel startlingly human.

But how do they actually work? And equally important: What do we, as NLP practitioners, need to understand in order to push the field forward, build responsibly, and use these tools well?

This course is about answering those questions.

### What You'll Learn

* The foundations of NLP: tokenization, embeddings, sequence models, attention.
* The evolution toward transformers and LLMs: how scaling laws, data, and architectures converged to create today’s systems.
* The practical side of NLP: building systems for classification, translation, summarization, question answering, and more.
* The critical perspective: fairness, bias, ethics, and the limitations of even the most advanced models.

### Why This Matters

NLP is no longer niche—it’s at the center of how humans interact with technology. Understanding the mechanics behind LLMs means understanding one of the most important computing revolutions of our time. By the end of this class, you won’t just use LLMs—you’ll know how they’re built, where they succeed, and where they fail.

### Your First Week

This week we'll get oriented. This class uses this website, Gradescope, Google slides, Colab, and not Canvas. Additionally, we'll be setting up our Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. I'll provide you with an access code for some credits to use for the semester.

For the first class,

* Lecture 1: From Rules to Transformers — the arc of NLP research leading to LLMs.
* Assignment 1: A first hands-on dive into working with real language data.
* Setup: Complete the Google Cloud lab so you’re ready to experiment at scale.

After the first class, I would advise you to do the following.

1. Read the syllabus carefully: [CS 6120 Spring Syllabus](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120s26/syllabus/)
2. Get your development environment ready with the lab instructions.
3. Start [Assignment 1 early](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6120s26/homework-1/) -- it’s your on-ramp to the course.

### Welcoming Notes

I’m excited to dive in with you this semester. NLP is one of the rare fields where you can see the theory, the code, and the real-world impact come together in real time—and you’re stepping into it at exactly the right moment.

See you soon from your instructional staff:
