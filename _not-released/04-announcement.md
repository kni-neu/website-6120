Use of AI tools, LLM, etc., is allowed on homeworks, labs, and projects, but discouraged to ensure proper learning of core competencies (i.e., used as a crutch.) Direct submissions are disallowed. Enforcement on homeworks, labs, and projects will be conducted by teaching assistant. Enforcement on big ticket items (i.e., exams) will be conducted by instructor and teaching assistant, where instructions explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.
